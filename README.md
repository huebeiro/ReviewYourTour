# ReviewYourTour
GYG Android Engineer Challenge

This repository contains two main directories: 
    AndroidApp, which contains the Android Studio project of the application;
    ServerMock, which contains the SoapUI project used to mock the post server;
    
If a new server is going to be mocked the value "mockServerAddress" inside the request.AddReviewRequest file needs to be updated in order to the post work.
